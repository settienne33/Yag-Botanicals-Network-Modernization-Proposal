Yagé Botanicals Network Modernization & Cloud Migration Proposal

A phased network modernization and cloud migration roadmap focused on improving the security posture of Yagé Botanicals, operational stability, and long-term scalability, through structured asset discovery, security hardening, monitoring, and governance.


The project delivers a step-by-step modernization strategy for an organization with outdated infrastructure and limited security controls. The proposal focuses on foundational security hardening, preparing systems for cloud adoption, and introducing long-term operational stability through monitoring, automation, and policy development.


Conducted asset discovery, vulnerability assessments, and CMDB planning that would deliver a complete inventory of the critical systems along with their related risks.

Implemented baseline security controls, such as next-generation firewalls, endpoint protection, multi-factor authentication, encryption, and least-privilege access.

Designed a multi-phase cloud migration strategy, considering Lift-and-Shift vs. Re-architecture across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Proposed continuous monitoring, using SOC/NOC models, SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic, SOAR automation, and recurring penetration testing.

Stabilized business operations through formal IT policies, employee cybersecurity training, automated backups, patching, and network segmentation-VLANs/micro-segmentation.
